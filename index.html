            <p> This is the home page of the Women of the Wichitas hiking group.<br>We are a group of women who enjoy getting outdoors
                and hiking in various parts of Oklahoma and Texoma. <br>We primarily hike in the Wichita Mountains, but occassionaly
                venture out experience other locations.<br>The group at the moment is made up of women only, but we do let men come along
                occasionaly.<br>Women in our neck of the woods seem to be less active in the outdoors scene compared to men, and it's with <br>the spirit
                of helping women feel more comfortable with getting out in the wilderness that led to the creation of this group of gals.<br>
                We've found that making it women only, for the most part, promotes more membership and makes us a little unique.<br>
                Always accepting new members! Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us to join up or for any questions/comments.<br>
                Hiking dates will be posted on the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>.</p>
